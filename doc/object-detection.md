### Object Detection

Pre-requisites for running the example:
* [Download and install](https://www.kogics.net/kojo-download) Kojo
* Extract the kojo-ai zip file for your platform under `~/kojo/extension` as explained in the [release notes](https://github.com/litan/kojo-ai-2/releases/tag/v0.4). This will *install* kojo-ai for you inside Kojo.
* Clone (or download/extract) this repo (this will give you easy access to the [images](../images) required by some of the examples).
* Download and extract the [saved model](https://github.com/litan/kojo-ai-2/releases/download/v0.2/object_detection_saved_model.zip) for this example.

After that, just run the example code below in Kojo.
